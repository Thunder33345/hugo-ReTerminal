## Features

- fully responsive

#### Built-in shortcodes

- **`image`** (props required: **`src`**; props optional: **`alt`**, **`position`** (**left** is default | center | right), **`style`**)
  - e.g.
  ```go
  {{< image src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
  ```
- **`figure`** (same as `image`, plus few optional props: **`caption`**, **`captionPosition`** (left | **center** is default | right), **`captionStyle`**)
  - e.g.
  ```go
  {{< figure src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Hello Friend!" captionPosition="right" captionStyle="color: red;" >}}
  ```
- **`code`** (props required: **`language`**; props optional: **`title`**, **`id`**, **`expand`** (default "△"), **`collapse`** (default "▽"), **`isCollapsed`**)
  - e.g.
  ```go
  {{< code language="css" title="Really cool snippet" id="1" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="true" >}}
  pre {
    background: #1a1a1d;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    font-size: 1rem;
    overflow: auto;

    @media (--phone) {
      white-space: pre-wrap;
      word-wrap: break-word;
    }

    code {
      background: none !important;
      color: #ccc;
      padding: 0;
      font-size: inherit;
    }
  }
  {{< /code >}}
  ```

#### Code highlighting

A custom syntax highlighting based on PrismJS. All you need to do is to wrap you code like this:

````
```html
  // your code here
```
````

## Configuration File

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy:

```toml
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
theme = "terminal"
paginate = 5

[params]
  # dir name of your main content (default is `content/posts`).
  # the list of set content will show up on your index page (baseurl).
  contentTypeName = "posts"

  # ["orange", "blue", "red", "green", "pink"]
  themeColor = "orange"

  # if you set this to 0, only submenu trigger will be visible
  showMenuItems = 2

  # show selector to switch language
  showLanguageSelector = false

  # set theme to full screen width
  fullWidthTheme = false

  # center theme with default width
  centerTheme = false

  # if your resource directory contains an image called `cover.(jpg|png|webp)`,
  # then the file will be used as a cover automatically.
  # With this option you don't have to put the `cover` param in a front-matter.
  autoCover = true

  # set post to show the last updated
  # If you use git, you can set `enableGitInfo` to `true` and then post will automatically get the last updated
  showLastUpdated = false

  # set a custom favicon (default is a `themeColor` square)
  # favicon = "favicon.ico"

  # Provide a string as a prefix for the last update date. By default, it looks like this: 2020-xx-xx [Updated: 2020-xx-xx] :: Author
  # updatedDatePrefix = "Updated"

  # set all headings to their default size (depending on browser settings)
  # oneHeadingSize = true # default

  # whether to show a page's estimated reading time
  # readingTime = false # default

  # whether to show a table of contents
  # can be overridden in a page's front-matter
  # Toc = false # default

  # set title for the table of contents
  # can be overridden in a page's front-matter
  # TocTitle = "Table of Contents" # default

[params.anchor]
    #hideOnList allows you to disable anchors for list
    hideOnList = false
    #hideOnList allows you to disable anchors for page
    hideOnPage = false

[params.twitter]
  # set Twitter handles for Twitter cards
  # see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution
  # do not include @
  creator = ""
  site = ""

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    languageName = "English"
    title = "Terminal"
    subtitle = "A simple, retro theme for Hugo"
    owner = ""
    keywords = ""
    copyright = ""
    menuMore = "Show more"
    readMore = "Read more"
    readOtherPosts = "Read other posts"
    newerPosts = "Newer posts"
    olderPosts = "Older posts"
    missingContentMessage = "Page not found..."
    missingBackButtonLabel = "Back to home page"

    [languages.en.params.logo]
      logoText = "Terminal"
      logoHomeLink = "/"

    [languages.en.menu]
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "about"
        name = "About"
        url = "/about"
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "showcase"
        name = "Showcase"
        url = "/showcase"
```

to `config.toml` file in your Hugo root directory and change params fields. In case you need, here's [a YAML version](https://gist.github.com/panr/9eeea6f595c257febdadc11763e3a6d1).
